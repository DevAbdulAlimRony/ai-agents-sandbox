## Install and can open agen from right top side.
## From agent, we can also toggle to the editor.
## Mode: Planning (Plan before execute), Fast (Executes directly, use for simple task.)
## Settings will be found above.

## Rules: Manually defined constraints for the Agent to follow, at both the local and global levels. 
   - Global Rule, or Workspace Wise Rule.
A Rule itself is simply a Markdown file, where you can input the constraints to guide the Agent to your tasks, stack, and style.
Global Rules: ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md
Workspace Rule:  .agent/rules.
                We can set the rule as manual activation, always on, model decision, glob.
                Mention by @
## Workflows: Workflows enable you to define a series of steps to guide the Agent through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or responding to PR comments.
Call workflow: /workflow-name.
You can also ask Agent to generate Workflows for you

## Skills:  A skill is a folder containing a SKILL.md file with instructions that the agent can follow when working on specific tasks.
Instructions for how to approach a specific type of task.
Best practices and conventions to follow.
Optional scripts and resources the agent can use.

If skill relavant then agent automatically considerr it.
Workspace specific skills: <workspace-root>/.agent/skills/<skill-folder>/
Global Skills: ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills/<skill-folder>/
Create a skill: .agen/skills/my-skil/SKILL.md. There can make more folders: scripts/, examples/, resources/
Every skill needs a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter at the top.

name: my-skill
description: Helps with a specific task. Use when you need to do X or Y.

# My Skill

Detailed instructions for the agent go here.

## When to use this skill

- Use this when...
- This is helpful for...

## How to use it

Step-by-step guidance, conventions, and patterns the agent should follow.

# Each skill should do one thing well
# The description is how the agent decides whether to use your skill.
# If your skill includes scripts, encourage the agent to run them with --help first rather than reading the entire source code.
# For complex skills, add a section that helps the agent choose the right approach based on the situation:
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code changes for bugs, style issues, and best practices. Use when reviewing PRs or checking code quality.
---

# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

## Review checklist

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?

## How to provide feedback

- Be specific about what needs to change
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest alternatives when possible

### In planning mode, if complex task, agent make task groups and work through tasks.
### When the agent wants to interact with the browser, it invokes a browser subagent to handle the task at hand. 
### In Secure Mode, the Agent's ability to interact with external websites is governed by the browser's Allowlist and Denylist
### andboxing provides kernel-level isolation for terminal commands executed by the Agent.
- When enabled, commands run in a restricted environment with limited file system and network access, protecting your system from unintended modifications.
- Commands can only write to your designated workspace directory and essential system locations. This prevents the Agent from accidentally deleting or modifying files outside your project.
# MCP(Model Context Protocol): Instead of manually pasting context (like database schemas or logs) into the editor, MCP allows Antigravity to fetch this information directly when needed.
- Exmp: Search Notion or GitHub for authentication patterns.
- Open the MCP Store, browse and install any MCP, authenticate and use.

# Task List: A task list is an artifact that the agent uses to approach complex tasks and monitor progress on various action items.
# Implementation Plan: Can make a plan first, then click implement.
# Walkthrough: A concise summary of the changes that have been made to remind the user of what has happened in the active conversation.
For broswer tasks, it sometimes contain screenshots and recordings.
## Knowledge Items: A Knowledge Item is a collection of related information on a specific topic
Antigravity automatically analyzes and extracts information from your conversation and uses that information to create new KIs or update existing KIs.
To View: Open Agen Manager, and then below in sidebar.
# Autocomplete: Ghost code appears at cursor. Can disable in settings.
# Inline Command: ctrl + I, type your request.
# Playground: Playgrounds are independent workspaces that allow you to start a conversation and explore ideas instantly.
From agent, just turn on the playground.
# Toggle Terminal: Ctrl + J
# Chrome Extension: Antigravity Browser Extension is required for the Antigravity Agent to access the web.
