It can help with anything you can do from the command line: writing docs, running builds, searching files, researching topics, and more.
## Can use cloude, desktop application, mobile application.
## Can make AI agent using aircrafts and publish for public and search engine to be used by anyone.
## Can use Extension in vs code, in github action, chrome extension.

# By CLI:

claude
/login
write the promt
Use git with Claude Code: what files have I changed?
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
show me the last 5 commits
help me resolve merge conflicts

## Commands:
Run a one time task: claude "task.."
Run one-off query, then exit: claude -p "query"
Continue most recent conversation in current directory: claude -c
Resume a previous conversation: claude -r
Create a Git commit: claude commit
Clear conversation history: /Clear
Show available commands: /help
exit or ctrl + c

## Promts:

### Extend Claude:
- CLAUDE.md adds persistent context Claude sees every session
- Skills add reusable knowledge and invocable workflows
- MCP connects Claude to external services and tools
- Subagents run their own loops in isolated context, returning summaries
- Hooks run outside the loop entirely as deterministic scripts
- Plugins and marketplaces package and distribute these features
###
But, too much can fill up your context window, but it can also add noise that makes Claude less effective; skills may not trigger correctly, or Claude may lose track of your conventions.
Claude.md will run for every request, so be sure with that.
MCP Servers will run for every session.
Skills will run when used
Hooks will run when trigger.

## Eample Workflows:
1. Understanding a new project:
   Give me an overview of this codebase
   Explain the main architecture patterns used here
   Explain the main architecture patterns used here
   Find the files that handle user authentication.
2. Fix Bugs:
   > I'm seeing an error when I run npm test
   > suggest a few ways to fix the @ts-ignore in user.ts
3. Refactor Code:
   > find deprecated API usage in our codebase
   > suggest how to refactor utils.js to use modern JavaScript features
   > refactor utils.js to use ES2024 features while maintaining the same behavior
   > run tests for the refactored code.
4. Use sub agent:
   > /agents
   > review my recent code changes for security issues
   > run all tests and fix any failures
   > use the code-reviewer subagent to check the auth module
4. Plan:
   claude --permission-mode plan -p "Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements"
5. Tests:
   > find functions in NotificationsService.swift that are not covered by tests
   > add tests for the notification service
   > add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service
   > summarize the changes I've made to the authentication module
6. Documentation
7. Work with Images: add an image
   > What does this image show?
   > Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
   > Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
   > This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
   > Generate CSS to match this design mockup
7. Reference:
   > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
8. MCP Reference:
   > Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
9. Ask claude about its capabilities
10. Database Querying: How many broiler farmers have ended flocks?
Do I have any user who follow up a farmer today?
We can test like that on local or live database to fix any issue mismatched.
Claude will write query behind the scene.
11. Run all pages in build mode , in dev mode, and give all console error, network error etc.
12. A new error occurred. Read the log file, tell me the problem and fix the error.

## Name your session: > /rename auth-refactor. Best practice to find it later.
## Runparallel session with git worktrees: git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

## When we use so much global context in md file like laravel boost, it will be sometimes cofusing. So, make when needs.

## If we work in the same chat continually, the all previous promts result will be the context for the current promt, so
- It will be more time consuming, costly and confusing for AI. so, for every new unrelated task, use new chat in cursor or in extension.

## Best Practices:
- Give claude a way to verify its work like open the form add a data and test if everything works perfectly no console errror.
- UI changes can be verified using the Claude in Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works.
- Enter Plan Mode. Claude reads files and answers questions without making changes, Ask Claude to create a detailed implementation plan., Ask Claude to commit with a descriptive message and create a PR, Then implement based on plan.
- Provide specific context in your prompts: Scope the task, point to sources, reference existing patterns, describe the symptomp.
- Reference file with @, paste image directly, give URLs.
- Write an effective CLAUDE.md. Include:
  - Bash commands Claude can’t guess
  - Code style rules that differ from defaults
  - Testing instructions and preferred test runners
  - Repository etiquette (branch naming, PR conventions)
  - Architectural decisions specific to your project
  - Developer environment quirks (required env vars)
  - Common gotchas or non-obvious behaviors
- claude md can take imported md:
  # Additional Instructions
  - Git workflow: @docs/git-instructions.md
  - Personal overrides: @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
- We can take Claude.md file in root folder with gitignore, or ./claude/CLAUDE.md, project directories, child directories.
- Run /hooks for interactive configuration, or edit .claude/settings.json directly.
- Create SKILL.md files in .claude/skills/ to give Claude domain knowledge and reusable workflows.

  # API Conventions
  - Use kebab-case for URL paths
  - Use camelCase for JSON properties
  - Always include pagination for list endpoints
  - Version APIs in the URL path (/v1/, /v2/)

  name: fix-issue

  disable-model-invocation: true

  Analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.

  1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
  2. Understand the problem described in the issue
  3. Search the codebase for relevant files
  4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
  5. Write and run tests to verify the fix
  6. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
  7. Create a descriptive commit message
  8. Push and create a PR
- Subagents run in their own context with their own set of allowed tools. They’re useful for tasks that read many files or need specialized focus without cluttering your main conversation.
  ---
  name: security-reviewer
  description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
  tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
  model: opus
  ---
  You are a senior security engineer. Review code for:
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
  - Authentication and authorization flaws
  - Secrets or credentials in code
  - Insecure data handling
  Provide specific line references and suggested fixes.
- Tell Claude to use subagents explicitly: “Use a subagent to review this code for security issues.”
- Ask Claude to Know: What edge cases does CustomerOnboardingFlowImpl handle?
- Esc:  Stop Claude mid-action with the Esc key.
- Esc + Esc or /rewind: Open the rewind menu and restore previous conversation and code state.
- /clear: Reset context between unrelated tasks.
- "Undo that": Have Claude revert its changes.
- During long sessions, Claude’s context window can fill with irrelevant conversation, file contents, and commands. Use clear, or new chat.
- Run multiple sessions: Claude Desktop, Claude Code on the web.

- Claude is good for backend changes, gemini is good for frontend etcs. Toggle model for tasks.

## Web:
- Visit claude.ai/code
- Connect your GitHub account
- Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories
- Select your default environment
- Submit your coding task
- Review changes in diff view, iterate with comments, then create a pull request

Promt: Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box,
type "hooks", and tell me what results appear.
- I just updated the login form validation. Can you open localhost:3000,
  try submitting the form with invalid data, and check if the error
  messages appear correctly?
- Open the dashboard page and check the console for any errors when
  the page loads.
- I have a spreadsheet of customer contacts in contacts.csv. For each row,
  go to our CRM at crm.example.com, click "Add Contact", and fill in the
  name, email, and phone fields.
- Draft a project update based on our recent commits and add it to my
  Google Doc at docs.google.com/document/d/abc123

  availability for each item. Save the results as a CSV file.
- Check my calendar for meetings tomorrow, then for each meeting with
  an external attendee, look up their company on LinkedIn and add a
  note about what they do.
