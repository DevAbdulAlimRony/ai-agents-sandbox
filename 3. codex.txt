### Codex:
- Codex is OpenAI’s coding agent for software development. 
- Included in GPT's  Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans.
- Setup: Codex Extension or Using CLI: npm install -g @openai/codex.
- or, in cloud: https://chatgpt.com/codex. Connect a github repository and use.

- Promt Example: Explain how the transform module works and how other modules use it.
- Threads: A thread is a single session, multiple promts following a promt.
- Can run multiple threads at once, dont point same file to edit in multiple threads at atime.
- Context: References to relevant files and images
- Verfification promt: Summarize the request flow as a numbered list of steps. Then list the files involved.

Workflow:
- Using CLI: write command - codex.
- I need to understand the protocol used by this service. Read @foo.ts @schema.ts and explain the schema and request/response flow. Focus on required vs optional fields and backward compatibility rules.
- @ for file name, /mention to attach a specific file.

- Bug Fixing Promt:
Bug: Clicking "Save" on the settings screen sometimes shows "Saved" but doesn't persist the change.
Repro:
1) Start the app: npm run dev
2) Go to /settings
3) Toggle "Enable alerts"
4) Click Save
5) Refresh the page: the toggle resets

Constraints:
- Do not change the API shape.
- Keep the fix minimal and add a regression test if feasible.

Start by reproducing the bug locally, then propose a patch and run checks.
Additional Promt: After the fix, run lint + the smallest relevant test suite. Report the commands and results.

- Can open the file then write promt.

- Test Writting:
Write a unit test for this function. Follow conventions used in other tests.
Add a test for the invert_list function in @transform.ts. Cover the happy path plus edge cases.

- Prototype from a screenshot:
Save your screenshot locally, then promt:
Create a new dashboard based on this attched image.

Constraints:
- Follow language, design and visual patterns from other files in this project.
- Match spacing, typography, and layout as closely as possible.

Deliverables:
- A new route/page that renders the UI
- Any small components needed
- README.md with instructions to run it locally.
For best results, include any non-obvious behavior in text (hover states, validation rules, keyboard interactions).
Verification: Start the dev server and tell me the local URL/route to view the prototype.

- See Live update when designing:
In cli- codex, in another window: npm run dev, promt: Propose 2-3 styling improvements for the landing page.

- Refactoring:
$plan

We need to refactor the auth subsystem to:
- split responsibilities (token parsing vs session loading vs permissions)
- reduce circular imports
- improve testability

Constraints:
- No user-visible behavior changes
- Keep public APIs stable
- Include a step-by-step migration plan

Revise the plan to:
- specify exactly which files move in each milestone
- include a rollback strategy

- Code Reviewing: codex, /review  Focus on edge cases and security issues
- Review on Github Pull: @codex review, @codex review for security vulnerabilities and security concerns

- Update Documentation:
Identify the doc file(s) to change and open them (IDE) or @ mention them (IDE or CLI).
Promt Exmp: Update the "advanced features" documentation to provide authentication troubleshooting guidance. Verify that all links are valid.

- IDE Extension: can select model, switch mode- chat,agen, agent full access. write /local to get into the local environment, /cloud to get into the cloud environment.
- /review, /status, /feedback

Tips:
Copy paste screenshot, can you fix alignment here?
/review befor comit any changes.
Can create a plan in document then give the plan to implement.
:go ahead and do the following:
1. investigate <feature A>
2. think about how to implement <feature B>
3. create a sectioned checklist to implement <feature B> where each section is a phase can

- Alias for getting high reasoning, web serach enabled and all permissions enabled:
alias c="codex -m gpt-5-codex -c model_resoning_effort='high' --search --yolo"
- Do your important work on Codex CLI and get in the habit of offloading small bugs to Codex Cloud to parallelize your work.

- For your git repository, we can add AGENTS.md so that all team members ai can be trained on the instructions base:
- Codex reads AGENTS.md files before doing any work. By layering global guidance with project-specific overrides, you can start each task with consistent expectations, no matter which repository you open.
- Use ~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md when you need a temporary global override without deleting the base file. Remove the override to restore the shared guidance.
- Add overrides in nested directories when specific teams need different rules. For example, inside services/payments/ create AGENTS.override.md
- Codex reports the global file first, the repository root AGENTS.md second, and the payments override last.
- 
# AGENTS.md

## Code Style
- Use Black for Python formatting.
- Avoid abbreviations in variable names.

## Testing
- Run pytest tests/ before finalizing a PR.
- All commits must pass lint checks via flake8.

## PR Instructions
- Title format: [Fix] Short description
- Include a one-line summary and a "Testing Done" section

- We can write configurations in .codex/config.toml if want to share same cofig across team with default options.
- We can set rules in ./codex/rules/ to control which commands codex can run outside the sandbox.

- MCP: Model Context protocol
- It connects models to tools and context.
- Configure in config.toml
- Like connect with figma, notion
- Useful MCP servers: 
Context7: Connect to up-to-date developer documentation.
Figma Local and Remote: Access your Figma designs.
Playwright: Control and inspect a browser using Playwright.
Chrome Developer Tools: Control and inspect Chrome.
Sentry: Access Sentry logs.
GitHub: Manage GitHub beyond what git supports (for example, pull requests and issues).

- Skills:
- Give Codex new capabilities and expertise.
- A skill packages instructions, resources, and optional scripts so Codex can follow a workflow reliably.
- You can share skills across teams or with the community. 
- Can create: .codex/skills: SKILL.md, scripts/, references/, assets/
- To select one, run the /skills slash command, or start typing $ to mention a skill. 
- Can enable or disable skill in config file.

Skill instructions for the Codex agent to follow when using this skill.
- We can install or download skills from other repositories also.
- Use skills when you want to share behavior across a team, enforce consistent workflows, or encode best practices once and reuse them everywhere.
- Create a Skill: $skill-creator, promt: Create a skill that drafts a conventional commit message based on a short summary of changes.
- or manually in .codex/skills/skill-name:
---
name: draft-commit-message
description: Draft a conventional commit message when the user asks for help writing a commit message.
metadata:
  short-description: Draft an informative commit message.
---

Draft a conventional commit message that matches the change summary provided by the user.

Requirements:

- Use the Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): summary`
- Use the imperative mood in the summary (for example, "Add", "Fix", "Refactor")
- Keep the summary under 72 characters
- If there are breaking changes, include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

- Codex SDK:
If in our app, we are adding any coding automation.
npm install @openai/codex-sdk
import { Codex } from "@openai/codex-sdk";

const codex = new Codex();
const thread = codex.startThread();
const result = await thread.run(
  "Make a plan to diagnose and fix the CI failures"
);

- Codex CLI:
codex login
codex "explain this codebase"
codex resume
codex resume --all
codex exec resume --last "Fix the race conditions you found"
codex --model gpt-5-codex
codex -i screenshot.png "Explain this error"
codex --image img1.png,img2.jpg "Summarize these diagrams"
--add-dir
--ask-for-approval, -a
etc.

- Slash commands: /, /compact, /diff, /exit, /feedback, /init, /logout, /mcp, /mention, /model, /resume, /new, /quit, /review etc.

* Can instruct to see git commit to everything related to git.
